 /*										*****New space to put all UristMcStation Clothing*****

Please keep it tidy, by which I mean put comments describing the item before the entry. Icons go to 'icons/urist/uristclothes.dmi'
All UMcS clothing will now go here, to prevent unecessary .dm's. I mean, how much clothes do we need anyways... -Glloyd*/
